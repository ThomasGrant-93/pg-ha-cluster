# NOTE! This Git ignore uses recommended technique
# Where everything is excluded by default and you deliberately
# Add only those directories/files you need. This is very useful
# To make sure that Git context is always the same on any machine
# So that generated files are not accidentally added to the context

# Ignore everything

# Allow only these directories
